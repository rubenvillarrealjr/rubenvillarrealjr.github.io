    <h1>RUBEN VILLARREAL JR</h1>
    <p>This is my professional website. Currently, I'm a ancillary benefits specialist (officially a Small Buisness Consultant) for Unum. I work with brokers and clients, advising groups in the 2-99 lives space on the best insurance plans/designs for their group's needs. I am currently licensed in Illinois and Wisconsin as a Resident Producer and Intermediary Agent, respectively. 
    <p>Prior to Unum, I was a trust and safety specialist who worked on <a href = "https://crisisresponse.google/" target = "_blank">Google's Crisis Response Project</a>.</p>
    <p>On the "personal development"-side, I love tinkering with my hands, like building PCs or doing home improvement/DIY, as well as furthering my SQL experience with work and pet projects. Want to know more about my expertise? Check out my <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruben-villarreal-jr/" target = "_blank">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
    <p>If you'd like to talk to me, best way would be through <a href = "mailto: rubenvillarrealjr9@gmail.com">email</a>, or through my aforementioned LinkedIn.</p>
    <p>Promise to get back to you asap.</p>
